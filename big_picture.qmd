# Toxic Truths: What the Data Says About What We Breathe

Air pollution isn’t just about hazy skies or highway smog—it’s about **who bears the health burden**. In California, a state often praised for its environmental standards, our analysis reveals a deeper, more troubling reality: **pollution isn’t distributed equally**, and race plays a powerful role in who’s exposed.

## Pollution Has a Pattern

We analyzed data across thousands of California census tracts, looking not only at environmental hazards—like diesel emissions, hazardous waste sites, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)—but also at the people who live in those communities.

The trend is unmistakable: **neighborhoods with larger Hispanic and African American populations tend to face significantly higher pollution burden scores**. These aren't just statistical quirks—they’re reflections of decades of zoning, housing policy, and infrastructure development that placed marginalized communities closer to environmental harm.

Even after controlling for other factors, the disparities hold. It’s a pattern many environmental justice advocates have long warned about. Now the data confirms it.

## Explore It Yourself

Curious how your county compares? Use the interactive tool below to explore the relationship between pollution burden and demographic makeup. Pick a county and a group—Hispanic, White, African American, and more—to see how pollution tracks with population.

```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 500

library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_rds("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sussmanbu/ma4615-sp25-final-project-data-warriors/main/dataset_for_shiny/county_demographic.rds")

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Explore Pollution Burden by County and Demographics"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("county", "Select a County:",
                  choices = sort(unique(data$`California County`))),
      selectInput("demographic", "Select Demographic Group:",
                  choices = c("Hispanic (%)", "White (%)", "African American(%)", "Asian American (%)", "Native American (%)", "Other/Multiple (%)"))
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("demoPlot")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$demoPlot <- renderPlot({
    plot_data <- data %>% filter(`California County` == input$county)

    ggplot(
      plot_data,
      aes_string(
        x = paste0("`", input$demographic, "`"),
        y = "`Pollution Burden Score`"
      )
    ) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "darkblue") +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
      labs(
        title = paste("Pollution vs.", input$demographic, "in", input$county),
        x = input$demographic,
        y = "Pollution Burden Score"
      ) +
      theme_minimal()
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

## Why It Matters

Clean air is a public good—but it hasn’t been equally shared. Communities of color, particularly Hispanic and African American residents, are more likely to live in areas with higher pollution, even after accounting for health and environmental factors.

This isn’t just about fairness—it’s about health equity. Pollution burden is linked to higher rates of asthma, cardiovascular disease, and low birth weight. If we want a future where everyone breathes easy, we need policy that **prioritizes the communities that have been left to bear the brunt of environmental harm**.

## The Bottom Line

**Environmental justice isn’t just an idea—it’s measurable.** And our data shows the need for targeted solutions: stronger regulations, better urban planning, and a commitment to equity in public health. California’s air may be cleaner than most—but it’s not clean for everyone.
