    "text": "Data Description\nThe CalEnviroScreen data, available for download at “OEHHA’s website”, is compiled by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) under the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA). This dataset is designed to assess cumulative environmental burdens and population vulnerabilities across California’s communities, specifically at the census tract level. It includes indicators on pollution exposure, environmental effects, sensitive populations, and socioeconomic factors, allowing policymakers, researchers, and the public to identify areas most impacted by environmental hazards. The data was collected to support state efforts in environmental justice and resource allocation, particularly to assist in directing funding and policy initiatives to disadvantaged communities. By integrating environmental and demographic data, CalEnviroScreen provides a comprehensive tool for understanding disparities in environmental health risks across the state.\nThe data has been used for research in the San Ysidro, California community because it’s located near the world’s busiest border crossing. Residents were predominately from marginalized communities and had complained that government air monitoring did not adequately measure air quality in their community. By collaborating with the San Ysidro community in San Diego, the OEHHA was able to collect data using low-cost technology to prioritize funding for identifying California communities with higher pollution burden scores and demographic vulnerabilities.\nThe CalEnviroScreen data has been used effectively in identifying the affected communities hence calling for policy action to direct cap-and-trade revenues to highly impacted areas, and also has been updated over the years to include more indicators and greater geographic specificity. This information is used by policymakers to allocate funds for environmental justice, guide regulatory enforcement, and support programs that target pollution control and public health improvements."

    "text": "Data Files and Description\nThe original data was downloaded from CalEnviroScreen 4.0, which provides statewide data on environmental and demographic indicators at the census tract level. The data came in a single Excel file with multiple sheets. One sheet contained pollution and environmental exposure indicators, while another contained population and demographic characteristics. To prepare the data for analysis, we extracted each of these sheets and saved them as separate CSV files: pollution_data.csv and demographic_data.csv.\nThe pollution_data.csv file includes key variables such as Ozone, PM2.5, Diesel PM, and Traffic, along with their respective percentiles (e.g., “Ozone Pctl”, “PM2.5 Pctl”). These values quantify the level of environmental pollution affecting each census tract. It also includes summary indicators such as “Pollution Burden Score” and “CES 4.0 Score”, which are composite measures used by the state to assess environmental vulnerability.\nThe demographic_data.csv file contains population-level statistics, including Total Population, Children &lt; 10 years (%), and Elderly &gt; 64 years (%), as well as racial and ethnic breakdowns such as Hispanic (%), African American (%), and Asian American (%). These demographic variables allow for an assessment of how pollution levels intersect with age and race across regions.\nTo simplify the analysis, we focused on the most relevant environmental and demographic variables and removed columns related to less directly useful metrics like groundwater threats, education, and unemployment. Together, the cleaned and merged dataset allows us to explore the relationship between environmental burdens and community demographics in California.\n\nVariable description:\nKey variables include:\nEnvironmental Related statistics: like Pollution Burden Score, which is a score scaled from 1 -10 and weighs both environmental effects and pollution indictors. It is the outcome variable we’re attempting to measure the effect size with.\nLocation: California county that the census tract falls within\nRace: The percentage of each racial group in each census tract.\nOther related statistics: Like poverty, education level, unemployment rate, Housing burden, Birth weight, potentially revealing relationships between those statistics and environmental levels.\n\n\nOfficial Data Dictionary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCensus Tract\nCensus Tract ID from the 2010 Census\n\n\nTotal Population\nEstimated population in each census tract (2019 ACS)\n\n\nCalifornia County\nCounty in which each census tract is located\n\n\nZIP\nZIP code for each census tract\n\n\nApproximate Location\nApproximate city or area name based on boundary files\n\n\nLongitude\nLongitude of the census tract centroid\n\n\nLatitude\nLatitude of the census tract centroid\n\n\nCES 4.0 Score\nFinal CalEnviroScreen score (Pollution Burden × Pop.

The pollution score with the highest frequency observed is 5.0. However, our project aims to determine if census tracts with greater pollution scores might be communities with higher racial/ethnic minority populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots above shows the distribution of the percentage of demographics in each census tract. We observed that census tracts with a higher percentages of individuals in the age range 10 to 64 years old were more common, and that so were census tracts with higher percentages of White individuals. However, the distribution seems to be widely dispersed with various outliers for each demographic catergory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics for Numerical Variables\n\n\nIncludes mean, median, minimum, and maximum values\n\n\nVariable\nMean\nMedian\nMinimum\nMaximum\n\n\n\n\nCensus Tract\n6,054,895,764.00\n6,059,052,505.00\n6,001,400,100.00\n6,115,041,100.00\n\n\nTotal Population\n4,889.05\n4,615.00\n0.00\n38,754.00\n\n\nLongitude\n−119.41\n−118.43\n−124.30\n−114.31\n\n\nLatitude\n35.50\n34.21\n32.55\n41.95\n\n\nCES 4.0 Score\n28.32\n25.55\n1.03\n93.18\n\n\nCES 4.0 Percentile\n50.01\n50.00\n0.01\n100.00\n\n\nOzone\n0.05\n0.05\n0.03\n0.07\n\n\nOzone Pctl\n50.90\n50.54\n0.19\n100.00\n\n\nPM2.5\n10.15\n10.12\n1.88\n16.39\n\n\nPM2.5 Pctl\n50.01\n50.01\n0.01\n100.00\n\n\nDiesel PM\n0.23\n0.14\n0.00\n14.61\n\n\nDiesel PM Pctl\n50.01\n50.01\n0.01\n100.00\n\n\nTox.

    "text": "Data Loading and Cleaning\nMerging Pollution and Demographic Data For this project, we worked with two datasets: pollution_data.csv and demographic_data.csv. Both datasets were read into R using the read_csv() function from the tidyverse package, and saved as .rds files using write_rds() for easier access later. The two datasets share some columns, including Total Population, California County, CES 4.0 Score, CES 4.0 Percentile, and CES 4.0 Percentile Range. So these columns were dropped from the pollution_data dataset before being merged with the demographic_data dataset. This was done using the following code:\n\npollution_data &lt;- pollution_data |&gt; \n    select(-c('Total Population', 'California County', 'CES 4.0 Score', 'CES 4.0 Percentile', 'CES 4.0 Percentile Range'))\n\nThe two datasets were then joined using a left join on the shared column “Census Tract” to ensure that all pollution records remained, even if corresponding demographic data was missing. This was done with the following line of code:\n\ncleaned_dataset &lt;- \n  left_join(pollution_data, demographic_data, by =\"Census Tract\")\n\nRemoving Columns\nAfter merging, we removed several columns that were not relevant to our analysis. The original dataset included data for both air and water pollution. However, since our project is focused on air pollution we have removed the columns relevant to water pollution. These included environmental and social indicators such as drinking water, lead, pesticides, unemployment, and housing burden. Because the merge process introduced suffixes like .x and .y to distinguish duplicate column names, we used a for loop combined with select(-contains(…)) to remove all columns containing those key patterns, regardless of suffix:\n\ncolumns_to_remove_patterns &lt;- c(\n\"Drinking Water\", \"Lead\", \"Pesticides\", \"Groundwater Threats\", \"Imp. Water Bodies\", \"Education\", \"Linguistic Isolation\",\"Poverty\", \"Unemployment\", \"Housing Burden\"\n)\n\nfor (pattern in columns_to_remove_patterns) {\n  cleaned_dataset &lt;- cleaned_dataset |&gt;\n    select(-contains(pattern))\n}\n\nImputing Missing Values\nWe then checked for missing values using colSums(is.na(cleaned_dataset)) and found that several columns were missing data, particularly in Los Angeles. Despite this, we decided to impute any missing values using a k-nearest neighbors imputation method:\n\n# convert character columns to factors \ncleaned_dataset &lt;- cleaned_dataset |&gt;\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))\n\n# Impute any null values using KNN approach \npollution_recipe &lt;- recipe(~ ., data = cleaned_dataset) |&gt;\n  step_impute_knn(all_predictors(), , neighbors = 3)\n\nprepared_recipe &lt;- prep(pollution_recipe)\n\nimputed_data &lt;- bake(prepared_recipe, cleaned_dataset)\n\nWriting the Transformation to Cleaned Dataset\nFinally, the cleaned dataset was saved to an .rds file using:\n\nwrite_rds(cleaned_dataset, file = here::here(\"dataset\", \"cleaned_dataset.rds\"))\n\nAll steps were carried out using packages from the tidyverse, including dplyr and tidyr for data manipulation, readr for reading in the datasets, and gt for creating summary tables. We used the additional recipes package to use imputation to handle missing values using a KNN methodology. A full record of these operations is provided in the script: clean_data.R.\nMetrics on what data was missing in the original pollution dataset can be found in Blog Post 3."

    "text": "Over the past week, we made substantial progress in preparing our dataset for analysis. The original data came from the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Excel file, which included multiple sheets—one containing pollution and environmental exposure data, and another with demographic indicators. We exported each sheet into separate CSV files, resulting in pollution_data.csv and demographic_data.csv. These were then read into R using read_csv() and merged using a left join on the “Census Tract” column to retain all pollution records while appending demographic information wherever available. After the merge, we removed several columns that were not directly relevant to our analysis, such as “Drinking Water”, “Groundwater Threats”, “Unemployment”, and “Housing Burden”, using a loop with select(-contains(…)). This approach allowed us to cleanly remove both the original and duplicated columns (e.g., .x, .y suffixes) introduced during merging.\nWe also addressed missing values by running colSums(is.na(cleaned_dataset)) to identify which variables had the most missing data. After reviewing the results—where “Low Birth Weight” had the highest number of NA values—we chose to drop all rows with missing values using drop_na() to ensure a clean dataset moving forward.\nLooking ahead, we plan to begin our exploratory data analysis by visualizing how pollution exposure correlates with demographic indicators such as race, age, and income. We are also beginning to consider additional data sources that could enrich our analysis—such as housing data, health outcome statistics, or climate-related variables—to explore deeper patterns of environmental injustice and vulnerability across California communities."

Several notable patterns emerge:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral notable patterns emerge: - Pollution Burden Score is positively correlated with PM2.5, Diesel PM, Cleanup Sites, and Hispanic (%), suggesting that census tracts with higher pollution levels tend to have higher concentrations of these environmental burdens and a higher proportion of Hispanic residents.\n\nConversely, White (%) is negatively correlated with Pollution Burden Score and many pollution-related variables, indicating that predominantly white census tracts are less likely to be exposed to high pollution burdens.\nSeveral demographic indicators are strongly correlated with each other. For example, Pop. Char. Score and Pop. Char. are nearly collinear, and Pollution Burden, Pollution Burden Pctl, and Pollution Burden Score are all highly correlated, which could introduce multicollinearity if included together in a model.\nHigh correlations (e.g., &gt; 0.7 or &lt; -0.7) are visualized by dark red/blue tiles, which may indicate redundancy in predictors and motivate variable selection or transformation.\nSome demographic variables like African American (%), Asian American (%), and Low Birth Weight show weak or moderate correlations with pollution burden, suggesting these relationships are less straightforward and may require modeling to unpack fully."

    "text": "Dataset 1\nLink to Data Description: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4/about_data\nThe New York City Department of Investigation updates a dataset daily on pending, scheduled and executed evictions within the five boroughs from the year 2017 to the present. The data is compiled from the majority of New York City Marshals, who are independent public officials. The dataset has 104,860 rows that each represent a pending, scheduled, or executed eviction. It also has 20 columns, which iIncludes attributes, such as Court Index Number, Docket Number, Eviction Address, Apartment Number, Executed Date, Marshal First Name, Marshal Last Name, Residential or Commercial (property type), Borough, Zip Code and Scheduled Status (Pending/Scheduled). We will be able to download the data as a csv file from the NYC Open Data website and potentially explore questions, such as the relationship between NYC housing eviction rate and neighborhood, what neighborhoods are more often subject to evictions, and if there any patterns between the ethnic makeup of the neighborhood with the number of evictions. It may be a challenge to make connections to racial disparities because the dataset itself does not have racial demographic data and this would have to be sourced based on the zip codes of where the evictions are taking place.\n\n\nDataset 2\nLink to Data Description: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QRubjBCrkqe61iDkxFg7P_Lc1SkR2PhL/view?usp=sharing\nThe California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) developed a dataset with 8,035 census tracts and 58 columns to identify communities most burdened by pollution and vulnerable populations. It integrates environmental indicators (e.g., air pollution, drinking water contamination) and population characteristics (e.g., poverty, asthma rates, linguistic isolation) to guide environmental justice policies. Key research questions include whether communities with higher racial/ethnic minority populations face greater air pollution exposure and if specific racial/ethnic groups experience multiple pollution burdens disproportionately. A potential challenge is that the dataset only covers California, limiting generalizability to the U.S. Additionally, the racial/ethnic data is in a separate sheet, requiring a join on the Census Tract column for analysis. The data has been successfully loaded and is ready for cleaning.\n\n\nDataset 3\nLink to Data Description: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/rates-and-trends-in-hypertension-related-cardiovascular-disease-mortality-among-us-ad-2000-2fdf2\nThis dataset documents rates and trends in local hypertension-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) death rates. The dataset contains 1103872 rows and 24 columns, including information on county (or county equivalent) estimates of hypertension-related CVD death rates in 2000-2019 and trends during two intervals (2000-2010, 2010-2019) by age group (ages 35–64 years, ages 65 years and older), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic White), and sex (female, male). The rates and trends were estimated using a Bayesian spatiotemporal model and a smoothed over space, time, and demographic group. Rates are age-standardized in 10-year age groups using the 2010 US population."

    "text": "Our Progress\nOur team has officially decided to move forward with our project on disparities in air pollution exposure among racial and ethnic groups. We have made some progress on the Data page, working on the data description section. Our group has decided to split the parts of the rubric to complete the Data page. We are first working on each section of the page on a Google doc and will combine all of our work onto the qmd file later on.\nAs for the data, we are focused on integrating racial demographic information by joining our two datasets in the “Census Tract” column. This step allows us to analyze air pollution exposure in the context of racial and ethnic composition across different geographic areas. Currently, our data is separated into two files. One with information on air pollution and the other with demographic information. Once this integration is complete, our next steps will involve exploring and cleaning the data to address missing values, potential inconsistencies, and outliers. This will ensure the dataset is structured properly for in-depth analysis. In the coming weeks, we plan to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing trends and disparities to gain initial insights before diving into more advanced statistical and spatial analysis."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Our CalEnviroScreen data came in a single Excel file with multiple sheets. One sheet contained pollution and environmental exposure indicators and another sheet contained population and demographic characteristics. We joined these two datasets to inform our research question of understanding which demographics may be disproportionately impacted by environmental health risks. Both datasets contain a column named “Census Tract”, which allows us to do a left join on the pollution and environmental exposure indicators to add demographic information about each census tract. We used a left join to preserve all pollution data records while adding any available demographic data. The data joining process didn’t have too many challenges, but in order to ensure that columns were not duplicated between the pollution dataset and the demographic dataset, we had to drop the columns ‘Total Population’, ‘California County’, ‘CES 4.0 Score’, ‘CES 4.0 Percentile’, and ‘CES 4.0 Percentile Range’ from the demographic data first.\nOur initial findings suggest there’s a relationship between pollution burden and the proportion of a census tract that is Hispanic, which is from Blog post 4. However, in our next steps we also plan to explore the relationship between pollution scores and more columns within our dataset outside of demographics, such as poverty percentile, unemployment percentile, and housing percentile. This week we spent more time understanding what rows we missed out on by dropping any rows with nulls because initially when we were cleaning our dataset we removed any nulls. In our exploration we found that while the pollution data didn’t have any nulls in the pollution burden columns, the nulls were largely concentrated in many of the columns we planned to look into related to other characteristics including Housing Burden Pctl, Poverty Pctl, and Unemployment Pctl as seen in the code below. The nulls are also mainly concentrated in Los Angeles, Riverside, and Orange county. Moving forward we’d have to do more exploratory data analysis to understand the demographic communities we’d be missing out on by dropping these rows as a next step.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\npollution_data &lt;- read_rds(here::here(\"dataset/pollution_data.rds\"))\ndemographic_data &lt;- read_rds(here::here(\"dataset/demographic_data.rds\"))\n\ncolSums(is.na(pollution_data))\n\n               Census Tract            Total Population \n                          0                           0 \n          California County                         ZIP \n                          0                           0 \n       Approximate Location                   Longitude \n                          0                           0 \n                   Latitude               CES 4.0 Score \n                          0                         103 \n         CES 4.0 Percentile    CES 4.0 Percentile Range \n                        103                         103 \n                      Ozone                  Ozone Pctl \n                          0                           0 \n                      PM2.5                  PM2.5 Pctl \n                          0                           0 \n                  Diesel PM              Diesel PM Pctl \n                          0                           0 \n             Drinking Water         Drinking Water Pctl \n                         28                          28 \n                       Lead                   Lead Pctl \n                         96                          96 \n                 Pesticides             Pesticides Pctl \n                          0                           0 \n               Tox.

    "text": "Thesis\nPollution burdens in California disproportionately impact communities of color—especially Hispanic, African American, and Asian American populations—across census tracts, as measured by CalEnviroScreen scores. These disparities reflect deep-rooted structural inequities and demand targeted environmental and public health interventions.\n\n\nContinuing Exploratory Data Analysis\nOver the past few weeks, we extended our exploratory data analysis by digging deeper into relationships between racial/ethnic composition and pollution burden across California’s census tracts. Initially, we focused on distribution plots, county-level comparisons, and visual trends. As we moved forward, we examined linear relationships through scatterplots and began incorporating more statistical rigor through correlation matrices and formal regression modeling.\nOur bar chart analysis of missing CES 4.0 Scores by county revealed data gaps in certain regions—especially Los Angeles—which may reflect underreporting or challenges in data collection in historically underserved communities. We plan to revisit these data gaps by exploring whether additional demographic variables (like poverty or linguistic isolation) correlate with missingness, potentially indicating areas where additional monitoring efforts are needed.\nWe also added visualizations to explore relationships between pollution burden and asthma rates, age group distributions, and socioeconomic indicators. The correlation heatmap helped identify variables that strongly align with pollution scores, guiding our model design.\n\n\nModeling and Inference\nWe fit a linear regression model to quantify how racial and ethnic group percentages within a census tract predict the pollution burden score. The results are both statistically significant and substantively meaningful:\n\nHispanic (%): For every 1% increase in Hispanic population share, the pollution burden score increases by approximately 0.029 units (p &lt; 2e-16).\nAfrican American (%): Similarly, a 1% increase corresponds to a 0.018 unit increase in pollution burden.\nAsian American (%): A smaller but still significant increase of 0.012 per percentage point.\nNative American (%) and Other/Multiple (%) were negatively associated with pollution burden, though the estimates were smaller in magnitude.\n\nThis suggests that communities of color, especially Hispanic populations, face higher pollution burdens on average. While correlation is not causation, these associations are consistent with prior research and public health reporting.\nWe visualized these relationships with a coefficient plot, making the results interpretable even to non-technical audiences. The model’s R² value of 0.25 indicates that race alone explains a moderate portion of the variance in pollution burden, but other structural and geographic variables likely contribute as well.\n\n\nVisualization and Communication Polishing\nWe’ve taken several steps to polish our visualizations and make them more publication-ready:\n\nClear Titles & Captions: Each figure includes descriptive titles that summarize the insight (“Pollution vs. Hispanic (%)”, “Top 10 Polluted Counties”).\nFaceted Histograms: We used facet_wrap() to break down racial distribution histograms, improving clarity.\nColor Gradients: The use of viridis scales for bar charts improves accessibility and visual appeal.\nCoefficient Plots: These were added to supplement raw regression output and emphasize confidence intervals in a clean, annotated layout.\n\nAs a next step, we’re exploring ggpubr to further standardize styling across plots, and looking into interactive visualizations using plotly or DT tables to support user exploration in the Shiny app.\n\n\nReflection and Future Directions\nOur project reinforces a troubling but crucial finding: environmental inequity remains tightly linked to race in California. Communities of color are often located in higher-pollution census tracts, which can have long-term health and quality-of-life consequences. That said, there’s more to explore. Future directions include:\n\nIncorporating interaction terms (e.g., race × poverty) to understand compounding effects.\nIncluding geographic features (like proximity to highways or industrial zones).\nImproving spatial visualizations to highlight regional hot spots.\nCollaborating with policy experts or community organizations to translate findings into action.\n\nOur final Shiny app will bring this work together into an interactive tool where users can select counties and demographic groups to explore local pollution impacts. We hope it serves as both a resource for informed advocacy and a starting point for deeper community-driven research."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nMotivation\nThe analysis aims to investigate the relationship between demographic factors (e.g., race, ethnicity) and pollution burden in California’s census tracts. Understanding these relationships is essential for targeting environmental policies that mitigate pollution’s impact on vulnerable communities. By examining how demographic characteristics influence the pollution burden, we can highlight areas that may need focused intervention to reduce environmental inequities.\n\n\nKey Questions\nWe are particularly interested in understanding how the proportion of Hispanic, African American, and Asian American populations within census tracts correlates with the pollution burden score. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions:\n\nHow does the percentage of each racial/ethnic group (Hispanic, African American, Asian American, etc.) correlate with the pollution burden score in California census tracts?\nAre certain demographic groups more likely to live in high-pollution areas?\n\nTo explore these questions, we present visualizations and statistical models that analyze these relationships. The following figures and tables will provide insights into the distribution of demographic groups, the extent of pollution in different counties, and the impact of racial composition on pollution levels."

    "section": "Key Demographic Findings",
    "text": "Key Demographic Findings\nSeveral racial and ethnic group percentages are statistically significant predictors of Pollution Burden Score (log-transformed). The interpretation below assumes all predictors are also log-transformed unless otherwise noted.\n\nHispanic (%): A 1% increase in the Hispanic population share is associated with an estimated 7.1% decrease in the Pollution Burden Score, holding other factors constant (β = -0.071, p &lt; 0.001). This negative association is statistically significant and substantial, suggesting that tracts with larger Hispanic populations tend to experience higher pollution burdens.\nAfrican American (%): A 1% increase in African American population share corresponds to a 1.8% decrease in the Pollution Burden Score (β = -0.018, p &lt; 0.001), indicating a consistent and significant relationship. This further supports the presence of racial disparities in pollution exposure.\nAsian American (%): Interestingly, the percentage of Asian American residents shows a positive association (β = 0.006, p &lt; 0.001), meaning that census tracts with higher Asian American populations tend to have slightly lower pollution burden scores.\nWhite (%): The percentage of White residents has a strong negative coefficient (β = -0.020, p &lt; 0.001), which suggests that higher White population share is linked to lower pollution burdens, consistent with patterns of environmental advantage."

    "text": "Addressing the Key Questions\n\nDo demographic groups correlate with pollution burden?\nYes. The model identifies statistically significant associations between racial/ethnic composition and pollution burden, even after controlling for environmental and health-related predictors. The strongest associations appear for Hispanic and African American populations, both of which are negatively associated with the Pollution Burden Score—indicating greater exposure to pollution in these communities.\nAre some groups more likely to live in polluted areas?\nBased on the signs and magnitudes of the coefficients, Hispanic and African American populations are more likely to reside in areas with higher pollution burden, even after adjusting for confounding factors. These results align with broader findings in environmental justice research and highlight a need for targeted policy interventions."

    "text": "Limitations and Assumptions\nAs with any linear regression analysis, our model relies on several assumptions: linearity between predictors and response, homoscedasticity (constant variance), independence of observations, and normality of residuals. While the log-log transformation improved residual behavior, some mild skewness and heteroscedasticity may remain. Furthermore, multicollinearity among demographic variables was mitigated but not eliminated entirely.\nAdditionally, this analysis does not account for potential spatial correlation between neighboring tracts or time-varying pollution dynamics. Including temporal or spatial random effects, or using generalized additive models, could improve the robustness of our findings. Incorporating socioeconomic indicators such as income, education, and housing density would also enhance our understanding of environmental inequity."
