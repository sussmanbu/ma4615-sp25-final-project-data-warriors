Over the past week, we made substantial progress in preparing our dataset for analysis. The original data came from the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Excel file, which included multiple sheets—one containing pollution and environmental exposure data, and another with demographic indicators. We exported each sheet into separate CSV files, resulting in pollution_data.csv and demographic_data.csv. These were then read into R using read_csv() and merged using a left join on the "Census Tract" column to retain all pollution records while appending demographic information wherever available. After the merge, we removed several columns that were not directly relevant to our analysis, such as "Drinking Water", "Groundwater Threats", "Unemployment", and "Housing Burden", using a loop with select(-contains(...)). This approach allowed us to cleanly remove both the original and duplicated columns (e.g., .x, .y suffixes) introduced during merging.

We also addressed missing values by running colSums(is.na(cleaned_dataset)) to identify which variables had the most missing data. After reviewing the results—where "Low Birth Weight" had the highest number of NA values—we chose to drop all rows with missing values using drop_na() to ensure a clean dataset moving forward. 

Looking ahead, we plan to begin our exploratory data analysis by visualizing how pollution exposure correlates with demographic indicators such as race, age, and income. We are also beginning to consider additional data sources that could enrich our analysis—such as housing data, health outcome statistics, or climate-related variables—to explore deeper patterns of environmental injustice and vulnerability across California communities.
