In this analysis, we extend our exploratory data analysis (EDA) by investigating the relationships between pollution burden and demographic variables across California census tracts. Our goal is to determine whether the pollution burden disproportionately affects certain racial groups and to model this relationship statistically. By considering both breadth and depth in our analysis, we aim to uncover key trends that inform environmental justice discussions.


## Exploratory Analysis

### Demographic Distributions and Pollution Exposure
We decided to do a scatter plot comparing Pollution Burden and ethnic groups. We began by looking at the Hispanic population and plotted pollution burden scores against the percentage of Hispanic populations, showing a positive relationship. It will be interesting to see what the other populationâ€™s relationship is with pollution burden.

### Top 10 Most Polluted Counties
A summary of pollution burden by county reveals the ten most polluted counties in California. This ranking highlights the regions with the greatest environmental challenges. The most polluted county resulted in Los Angeles which confirmed our assumptions before EDA. This is reasonable as Los Angeles is a very densely populated county.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: "hide"

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data <- read_rds(here::here("dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds"))

data %>%
  group_by(`California County`) %>%
  summarise(mean_pollution = mean(`Pollution Burden Score`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  top_n(10, mean_pollution) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`California County`, mean_pollution), y = mean_pollution)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs( x = NULL, y = "Avg. Pollution Score")
```

## Pollution Burden Score vs Asthma

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
ggplot(data, aes(x = `Pollution Burden Score`, y = `Asthma`)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "orange") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Pollution Burden vs. Asthma Rate",
       x = "Pollution Burden Score",
       y = "Asthma Rate")
```

## Statistical Modeling

To formally assess the relationship between demographic composition and pollution burden, we fitted a multiple linear regression model:
    
y = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6

Where:

y = Pollution Burden Score <- our predictor variable

x1 = Hispanic (%)

x2 = African American (%)

x3 = Asian American (%)

x4 = Native American (%)

x5 = Other/Multiple (%)
    
Our model estimates indicate that higher percentages of Hispanic, African American, and Asian American populations are associated with increased pollution burden, while Native American and Other/Multiple groups show weaker associations.

## Correlation Matrix

The correlation matrix displays the pairwise Pearson correlations between numerical variables in the dataset, with darker shades indicating stronger relationships. Several notable patterns emerge:
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(corrplot)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data <- read_rds(here::here("dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds"))

exclude_vars <- c("CES 4.0 Score", "CES 4.0 Percentile", "CES 4.0 Percentile Range", "Pollution                        Burden Pctl", "Longitude", "Latitude", "Ozone Pctl", "PM2.5 Pctl","Diesel PM Pctl", "Tox. Release Pctl", "Traffic Pctl", "Cleanup Sites Pctl",  "Haz. Waste Pctl", "Solid Waste Pctl", "Pollution Burden", "Asthma Pctl", "Low Birth Weight Pctl", "Cardiovascular Disease Pctl","Pop. Char. Pctl")

numeric_data <- data |>
  select_if(is.numeric) |>
  select(-one_of(exclude_vars))

correlation_matrix_filtered <- cor(numeric_data, use = "complete.obs")

pollution_burden_corr <- correlation_matrix_filtered["Pollution Burden Score",]

sorted_corr <- sort(abs(pollution_burden_corr), decreasing = TRUE)

top_10_variables <- names(sorted_corr)

top_corr_matrix <- correlation_matrix_filtered[top_10_variables, top_10_variables]

corrplot(top_corr_matrix, 
         method = "color", 
         type = "upper", 
         title = "Correlation Matrix", 
         tl.cex = 0.45, 
         tl.srt = 75, # Rotate text labels for readability
         mar = c(0, 0, 2, 0), # Increase space around the plot
         number.cex = 0.7) # Adjust number size

```

Several notable patterns emerge:
- Pollution Burden Score is positively correlated with PM2.5, Diesel PM, Cleanup Sites, and Hispanic (%), suggesting that census tracts with higher pollution levels tend to have higher concentrations of these environmental burdens and a higher proportion of Hispanic residents.

- Conversely, White (%) is negatively correlated with Pollution Burden Score and many pollution-related variables, indicating that predominantly white census tracts are less likely to be exposed to high pollution burdens.

- Several demographic indicators are strongly correlated with each other. For example, Pop. Char. Score and Pop. Char. are nearly collinear, and Pollution Burden, Pollution Burden Pctl, and Pollution Burden Score are all highly correlated, which could introduce multicollinearity if included together in a model.

- High correlations (e.g., > 0.7 or < -0.7) are visualized by dark red/blue tiles, which may indicate redundancy in predictors and motivate variable selection or transformation.

- Some demographic variables like African American (%), Asian American (%), and Low Birth Weight show weak or moderate correlations with pollution burden, suggesting these relationships are less straightforward and may require modeling to unpack fully.

## Next Steps:
Our analysis suggests that the pollution burden is not evenly distributed across demographic groups, with Hispanic and African American communities experiencing the highest pollution levels. Further analysis could include:
- Exploring non-linear models or interaction effects.
- Incorporating socioeconomic factors such as income and housing density.
- Investigating potential policy interventions for mitigating disparities.
- Through continued analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of environmental justice in California.
