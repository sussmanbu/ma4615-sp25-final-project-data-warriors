In this analysis, we extend our exploratory data analysis (EDA) by investigating the relationships between pollution burden and demographic variables across California census tracts. Our goal is to determine whether the pollution burden disproportionately affects certain racial groups and to model this relationship statistically. By considering both breadth and depth in our analysis, we aim to uncover key trends that inform environmental justice discussions.

### Demographic Distributions and Pollution Exposure
We decided to do a scatter plot comparing Pollution Burden and ethnic groups. We began by looking at the Hispanic population and plotted pollution burden scores against the percentage of Hispanic populations, showing a positive relationship. It will be interesting to see what the other populationâ€™s relationship is with pollution burden.

### Top 10 Most Polluted Counties
A summary of pollution burden by county reveals the ten most polluted counties in California. This ranking highlights the regions with the greatest environmental challenges. The most polluted county resulted in Los Angeles which confirmed our assumptions before EDA. This is reasonable as Los Angeles is a very densely populated county.

## Statistical Modeling

To formally assess the relationship between demographic composition and pollution burden, we fitted a multiple linear regression model:
    
y = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6

Where:

y = Pollution Burden Score <- our predictor variable

x1 = Hispanic (%)

x2 = African American (%)

x3 = Asian American (%)

x4 = Native American (%)

x5 = Other/Multiple (%)
    
Our model estimates indicate that higher percentages of Hispanic, African American, and Asian American populations are associated with increased pollution burden, while Native American and Other/Multiple groups show weaker associations.

## Next Steps:
Our analysis suggests that the pollution burden is not evenly distributed across demographic groups, with Hispanic and African American communities experiencing the highest pollution levels. Further analysis could include:
- Exploring non-linear models or interaction effects.
- Incorporating socioeconomic factors such as income and housing density.
- Investigating potential policy interventions for mitigating disparities.
- Through continued analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of environmental justice in California.
