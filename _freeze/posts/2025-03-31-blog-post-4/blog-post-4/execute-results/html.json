Our goal is to determine whether the pollution burden disproportionately affects certain racial groups and to model this relationship statistically. By considering both breadth and depth in our analysis, we aim to uncover key trends that inform environmental justice discussions.\n\n### Demographic Distributions and Pollution Exposure\nWe decided to do a scatter plot comparing Pollution Burden and ethnic groups. We began by looking at the Hispanic population and plotted pollution burden scores against the percentage of Hispanic populations, showing a positive relationship. It will be interesting to see what the other populationâ€™s relationship is with pollution burden. \n\nFigure 1: Pollution Burden plotted against Hispanic Population Proportion \n\n![](/images/blog4_a.png){fig-alt=\"Pollution Burden vs Hispanic Population\"}\n\n### Top 10 Most Polluted Counties\nA summary of pollution burden by county reveals the ten most polluted counties in California. This ranking highlights the regions with the greatest environmental challenges. The most polluted county resulted in Los Angeles which confirmed our assumptions before EDA. This is reasonable as Los Angeles is a very densely populated county. \n\nFigure 2: Top 10 Most Polluted Counties \n![](/images/blog4_b.png){fig-alt=\"Top 10 Most Polluted Counties\"}\n\n## Statistical Modeling\n\nTo formally assess the relationship between demographic composition and pollution burden, we fitted a multiple linear regression model:\n    \ny = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6\n\nWhere:\n\ny = Pollution Burden Score <- our predictor variable\n\nx1 = Hispanic (%)\n\nx2 = African American (%)\n\nx3 = Asian American (%)\n\nx4 = Native American (%)\n\nx5 = Other/Multiple (%)\n    \nOur model estimates indicate that higher percentages of Hispanic, African American, and Asian American populations are associated with increased pollution burden, while Native American and Other/Multiple groups show weaker associations.\n\nFigure 3: Demographic Predictors of Pollution Burden\n![](/images/blog4_c.png){fig-alt=\"Demographic Predictors of Pollution Burden\"}\n\nThe correlation matrix displays the pairwise Pearson correlations between numerical variables in the dataset, with darker shades indicating stronger relationships. Several notable patterns emerge:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog-post-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSeveral notable patterns emerge:\n- Pollution Burden Score is positively correlated with PM2.5, Diesel PM, Cleanup Sites, and Hispanic (%), suggesting that census tracts with higher pollution levels tend to have higher concentrations of these environmental burdens and a higher proportion of Hispanic residents.\n\n- Conversely, White (%) is negatively correlated with Pollution Burden Score and many pollution-related variables, indicating that predominantly white census tracts are less likely to be exposed to high pollution burdens.\n\n- Several demographic indicators are strongly correlated with each other. For example, Pop. Char. Score and Pop. Char. are nearly collinear, and Pollution Burden, Pollution Burden Pctl, and Pollution Burden Score are all highly correlated, which could introduce multicollinearity if included together in a model.\n\n- High correlations (e.g., > 0.7 or < -0.7) are visualized by dark red/blue tiles, which may indicate redundancy in predictors and motivate variable selection or transformation.\n\n- Some demographic variables like African American (%), Asian American (%), and Low Birth Weight show weak or moderate correlations with pollution burden, suggesting these relationships are less straightforward and may require modeling to unpack fully.\n\n## Next Steps:\nOur analysis suggests that the pollution burden is not evenly distributed across demographic groups, with Hispanic and African American communities experiencing the highest pollution levels. Further analysis could include:\n- Exploring non-linear models or interaction effects.\n- Incorporating socioeconomic factors such as income and housing density.\n- Investigating potential policy interventions for mitigating disparities.\n- Through continued analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of environmental justice in California.\n",
